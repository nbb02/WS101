    info: `In 1913 Juan Gris began using the technique of papier collé developed by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, with whom he had been working in close contact since 1911. By 1914 Gris’s handling of the technique was personal and sophisticated, as evidenced by works such as Bottle of Rum and Newspaper, executed in Paris shortly before he left for Collioure at the end of June. Here the pasted elements overlap and intermesh with one another in relationships calculated with mathematical rigor. These collaged papers cover the entire surface of the canvas, simultaneously forming an abstract composition and serving as a multilayered support for naturalistic details.`,

    info: `This is Picasso's first Cubist sculpture and one of more than sixty Cubist paintings, sculptures, and drawings the artist made of his companion Fernande Olivier in 1909. Picasso modeled the bust in Paris after the couple returned from a summer trip to Spain. As in his early Cubist paintings, Fernande’s head is described in facets and voids. Intended to be seen in the round, the composition changes when viewed from different angles. The torque of the neck counters the downward tilt of the head and suggests movement, as if Fernande is about to look over her shoulder.`,

    info: `Violon et verre was painted in Paris in the spring of 1913, at the height of Braque's friendship with Picasso and at the climax of an intense debate and rivalry concerned with painting and the ideas of Cubism. It was in Sorgues in September 1912 that Braque, working alongside Picasso, had made the discovery of the papier coll technique, where materials from the everyday world, such as newspaper, wallpaper and oilcloth were placed on the canvas surface. As Golding has observed,`,

    info: `Guernica, a large black-and-white oil painting executed by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso in 1937 following the German bombing of Guernica, a city in Spain’s Basque region. The complex painting received mixed reviews when it was shown in the Spanish Republic Pavilion at the world’s fair in Paris, but it became an icon as it traveled the world in ensuing years, raising controversies on its meaning and its rightful home.`,

    artist: "Pablo Picasso",

    info: `The two figures at the right are the most aggressively abstracted with faces rendered as if they wear African masks. By 1907, when this painting was produced, Picasso had begun to collect such work. Even the striations that represent scarification is evident. Matisse and André Derain had a longer standing interest in such art, but Picasso said that it was only after wandering into the Palais du Trocadero, Paris’s ethnographic museum, that he understood the value of such art. Remember, France was a major colonial power in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries. Much African art was ripped from its original geographic and artistic context and sold in Paris. Although Picasso would eventually become more sophisticated regarding the original uses and meaning of the non-Western art that he collected, in 1907 his interest was largely based on what he perceived as its alien and aggressive qualities.`,
